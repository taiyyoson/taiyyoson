## About Me

### 🖥️
ご機嫌よう、諸君, my name is Taiyo Williamson, I'm a current second-year Computer Science candidate at the University of San Francisco. Outside of professional commitments (and anything tech-esque), I enjoy playing soccer and spikeball. I frequent the gym, I try my very hardest to improve my reading attention span, and I am an avid gamer--I currently do not have my PC with me, so I primarily play Brawl Stars. 

### 🌟 Projects & Language Preferences 🌟

### 👾
I use C and Java primarily. I also have some experience with multiple other frameworks and languages.

### 🗓️ (currently working on *project & work-related*)

### 🌱
I’m currently learning how to make neural networks without the help of ML libraries like TensorFlow. I am trying to construct my own deep learning and generative AI models, in particular. 


### 📫How to Reach Me 📫

I am available via email @ tpwilliamson.dons.usfca.edu, or LinkedIn. If for some reason you don't want to use my link on the left, I should pop up with a quick "Taiyo Williamson" search. I will not be giving you my phone number for obvious reasons, but I think you could probably find it with minimal digging.
