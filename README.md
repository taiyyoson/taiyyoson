## About Me

### 🖥️
My name is Taiyo Williamson, I'm a current second-year Computer Science candidate at the University of San Francisco. Outside of professional commitments (and anything tech-esque), I enjoy playing soccer and spikeball. I frequent the gym, I try my very hardest to improve my reading attention span, and I am an avid gamer--I currently do not have my PC with me, so I primarily play Brawl Stars. I have no shame about that; I also have no shame in admitting I have a minor addiction to the game, so much so that my girlfriend has to limit my screen time.

I am available via email @ tpwilliamson.dons.usfca.edu, or LinkedIn. I should pop up with a "Taiyo Williamson" search. I will not be giving you my phone number, for obvious reasons.
