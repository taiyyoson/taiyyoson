## About Me

### 🖥️
ご機嫌よう、諸君, my name is Taiyo Williamson, I'm a current second-year Computer Science candidate at the University of San Francisco. Outside of professional commitments (and anything tech-esque), I enjoy playing soccer and spikeball. I frequent the gym, I try my very hardest to improve my reading attention span, and I am an avid gamer--I currently do not have my PC with me, so I primarily play Brawl Stars. I have no shame about that; I also have no shame in admitting I have a minor addiction to the game, so much so that my girlfriend has to limit my screen time.

### 🌟 Projects & Language Preferences 🌟

### 👾
I prefer coding in Java, C, and Python, in that order. I view other languages as extensions of these three--I am also the most adept in these--so will not include them. 

### 🗓️
I am currently working on my Sudoku game (made in JS, HTML, and CSS), and I have HUUUUGGGEE plans for this summer. I have an internship set but will try to really commit to these two project ideas. And yes, it partially includes my interests in generative AI models.

### 🌱
I’m currently learning how to make neural networks without the help of ML libraries like TensorFlow. I am trying to construct my own deep learning and generative AI models, in particular. 


### 📫How to Reach Me 📫

I am available via email @ tpwilliamson.dons.usfca.edu, or LinkedIn. If for some reason you don't want to use my link on the left, I should pop up with a quick "Taiyo Williamson" search. I will not be giving you my phone number for obvious reasons, but I think you could probably find it with minimal digging.

### 💬

If for some reason I fit your needs--dunno why, I'm not special by any standards for now lmao--please feel free to contact me with whatever it is you wish to discuss.
(I'm only including this for when I become a more "notorious" developer. Obviously no one knows I exist atm)
